Below you can find the codes and previews of the GEE based web application which allows users to select a province and district to view the land use land cover and carbon storage data interactively. Moreover, for details of data availability, [check this](#national-scale-lulc-and-carbon-storage-data-availability).

## Web Application

### For Land use Land Cover (LULC) (1990-2020)

The LULC web application allows users to select province, and then district and based on these, the app visualizes the land cover for four durations (1990, 2000, 2010, and 2020). The LULC app can be accessed [here](https://waleedgis.users.earthengine.app/view/pakistan-lulc-1990-2020) or by clicking the figure below.

### For For Carbon Storage (1990-2020)

The Carbon Storage web application allows users to select province, and then district and based on these, the app visualizes the carbon storage for four durations (1990, 2000, 2010, and 2020). The carbon storage app can be accessed [here](https://waleedgis.users.earthengine.app/view/pakistan-carbon-1990-2020) or by clicking the figure below.

## National scale LULC and Carbon Storage data availability

- If you are interested in the dataset (land cover, carbon storage, and transition matrix) used in the study, please contact the authors directly:
[email: waleedgeo@outlook.com](mailto:waleedgeo@outlook.com).

- Currently, both datasets (LULC and Carbon Storage) are not open-sourced as we are further working on them. However, feel free to reach out to us for any queries or collaborations.
